Codecademy-Open-Project
=======================

This is an opportunity for EVERYONE who enjoys learning so much on Codecademy.com to share what they know and try to work together on some beautiful and new!

What I am suggesting we do, is create the most unique and dynamic web pages that you can from what you've learned with Codecademy.com.
From doing this, we can help show our appreciation to Codecademy.com and show others just what you can do from the skills learned there.
I'll be working on my page, and I hope you will too.

Create a folder with all of the files of your page(s) and load it into the repository!
